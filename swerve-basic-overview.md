# Swerve Basic Overview

Swerve is the most efficient holonomic drivetrain. Although any other drivetrain is easier to put together and code, swerve has many advantages on the field.&#x20;

With swerve, complex movements can be achieved that no other drivetrain could do. For example, with swerve you can strafe in any direction at full speed, and rotate the chassis while translating in a certain direction. In addition to that, swerve drive allows for using tank drive type wheels while still remaining holonomic. This gives higher traction on the field while still giving the high speed and maneuverability that is offered as long as you are holonomic.
